# GreenCARE - Design Project

GreenCARE is a conceptual design for a plant care application, created using Adobe XD. This project showcases the user interface design and user experience flow for a mobile application aimed at helping users manage their plant care routines.

## Project Overview

The GreenCARE design project includes:
- **Home Screen**: Overview of all plants and their care status.
- **Plant Details**: Detailed view of individual plant care instructions.
- **Watering Schedule**: Interface to manage and track watering schedules.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for upcoming plant care tasks.

## Adobe XD File

The Adobe XD file (`GreenCARE.xd`) contains all the screens and design components for the GreenCARE application. It demonstrates my proficiency in using Adobe XD for creating interactive and visually appealing UI designs.

## How to View the Design

To view and interact with the design:
1. Download the `GreenCARE.xd` file from this repository.
2. Open the file using Adobe XD or FIGPEA.

## Purpose

This project was created to enhance my skills in UI/UX design and to provide a tangible example of my design capabilities. It serves as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to create intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.
